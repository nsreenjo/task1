            <p id="Research"> Research on Prograph started at Acadia University in 1982 as a general investigation into dataflow languages,<br> 
                stimulated by a seminar on functional languages conducted by Michael Levin. Diagrams were used to clarify the discussion, leading to the insight:<br> 
                "since the diagrams are clearer than the code, why not make the diagrams themselves executable!" Thus Prograph - Programming in Graphics -<br> was born as a visual dataflow language. This work was led by Dr. Tomasz Pietrzykowski, with Stan Matwin and Thomas Muldner <br>co-authoring early papers. From 1983 to 1985, research prototypes were built on a Three Rivers PERQ graphics workstation (in Pascal, with the data<br> visualized as fireballs moving down datalinks), and a VAX with a Tektronix terminal, and an experimental<br> compiler was programmed in an IBM PC.
